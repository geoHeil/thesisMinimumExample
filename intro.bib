abstract = {In almost every scientific field, measurements are performed over time. These observations lead to a collection of organized data called time series. The purpose of time-series data mining is to try to extract all meaningful knowledge from the shape of data. Even if humans have a natural capacity to perform these tasks, it remains a complex problem for computers. In this article we intend to provide a survey of the techniques applied for time-series data mining. The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future. We hope that this article can provide a broad and deep understanding of the time-series data mining research field.},

The scope of this study is three-fold. Firstly, a novel modeling technique of the metered load data of a high voltage industrial consumer is introduced. Instead of representing the daily load curve with a vector with T elements, where T is the time interval of the metering, it is proposed to represent the demand with six indicators that are related with the shape of the curve. Secondly, a new clustering algorithm is introduced in the load time series segmentation field of research. Lastly, a new clustering validity indicator is proposed that can provide an accurate evidence on the optimal number of clusters. The data under study are the active and reactive metered load of a full year.},

@article{Keogh2005,
abstract = {The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dy- namic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexi- bility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we intro- duce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe an algorithm for clustering multivariate time series with variables taking both categorical and continuous values. Time series of this type are frequent in health care, where they represent the health trajectories of individuals. The problem is challenging because categorical variables make it difficult to define a meaningful distance between trajectories. We propose an approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), where we first map each trajectory into an HMM, then define a suitable distance between HMMs and finally proceed to cluster the HMMs with a method based on a distance matrix. We test our approach on a simulated, but realistic, data set of 1,255 trajectories of individuals of age 45 and over, on a synthetic validation set with known clustering structure, and on a smaller set of 268 trajectories extracted from the longitudinal Health and Retirement Survey. The proposed method can be implemented quite simply using standard packages in R and Matlab and may be a good candidate for solving the difficult problem of clustering multivariate time series with categorical variables using tools that do not require advanced statistic knowledge, and therefore are accessible to a wide range of researchers.},

abstract = {Division of a time series into segments is a common technique for time-series processing, and is known as segmentation. Segmentation is traditionally done by linear interpolation in order to guarantee the continuity of the reconstructed time series. The interpolation-based segmentation methods may perform poorly for data with a level of noise because interpolation is noise sensitive. To handle the problem, this paper establishes an explicit expression for segmentation from a compact representation for piecewise linear functions using hinging hyperplanes. This expression enables the use of regression to obtain a continuous reconstructed signal and, as a consequence, application of advanced techniques in segmentation. In this paper, a least squares support vector machine with lasso using a hinging feature map is given and analyzed, based on which a segmentation algorithm and its online version are established. Numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to existing segmentation algorithms.},

@unpublished{Strelioff2014,
abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian approach to discovering patterns in structurally complex processes. The proposed method of Bayesian structural inference (BSI) relies on a set of candidate unifilar hidden Markov model (uHMM) topologies for inference of process structure from a data series. We employ a recently developed exact enumeration of topological $\epsilon$-machines. (A sequel then removes the topological restriction.) This subset of the uHMM topologies has the added benefit that inferred models are guaranteed to be $\epsilon$-machines, irrespective of estimated transition probabilities. Properties of $\epsilon$-machines and uHMMs allow for the derivation of analytic expressions for estimating transition probabilities, inferring start states, and comparing the posterior probability of candidate model topologies, despite process internal structure being only indirectly present in data. We demonstrate BSI's effectiveness in estimating a process's randomness, as reflected by the Shannon entropy rate, and its structure, as quantified by the statistical complexity. We also compare using the posterior distribution over candidate models and the single, maximum a posteriori model for point estimation and show that the former more accurately reflects uncertainty in estimated values. We apply BSI to in-class examples of finite- and infinite-order Markov processes, as well to an out-of-class, infinite-state hidden process.},

abstract = {Time is an exceptional dimension that is common to many application domains such as medicine, engineering, business, science, biography, history, planning, or project management. Understanding time-oriented data enables us to learn from the past in order to predict, plan, and build the future. Due to the distinct characteristics of time, appropriate visual and analytical methods are required to explore and analyze them.This book starts with an introduction to visualization and a number of historical examples of visual representations. At its core, the book presents and discusses a systematic view of the visualization of time-oriented data. This view is structured along three key questions. While the aspects of time and associated data describe "what" is being visualized, user tasks are related to the question "why" something is visualized. These characteristics and tasks determine "how "the visualization is to be designed. To support visual exploration, interaction techniques and analytical methods are required as well, which are discussed in separate chapters. The concepts explained in this book are illustrated with numerous examples. A large part of this book is devoted to a structured survey of existing techniques for visualizing time and time-oriented data. Overall, 101 different visualization techniques are presented on a per-page basis; each of these self-contained descriptions is accompanied by an illustration and corresponding references. This survey serves as a reference for scientists conducting related research as well as for practitioners seeking information on how their time-oriented data can best be visualized in order to gain valuable insights.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for discovering patterns in time series and other sequential data. We exhibit a reliable procedure for building the minimal set of hidden, Markovian states that is statistically capable of producing the behavior exhibited in the data -- the underlying process's causal states. Unlike conventional methods for fitting hidden Markov models (HMMs) to data, our algorithm makes no assumptions about the process's causal architecture (the number of hidden states and their transition structure), but rather infers it from the data. It starts with assumptions of minimal structure and introduces complexity only when the data demand it. Moreover, the causal states it infers have important predictive optimality properties that conventional HMM states lack. We introduce the algorithm, review the theory behind it, prove its asymptotic reliability, use large deviation theory to estimate its rate of convergence, and compare it to other algorithms which also construct HMMs from data. We also illustrate its behavior on an example process, and report selected numerical results from an implementation.},

abstract = {We investigate techniques for analysis and retrieval of object
trajectories in two or three dimensional space. Such data usually
contain a large amount of noise, that has made previously used metrics
fail. Therefore, we formalize non-metric similarity functions based on
the longest common subsequence (LCSS), which are very robust to noise
and furthermore provide an intuitive notion of similarity between
trajectories by giving more weight to similar portions of the sequences.
Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global
translation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms
that compute these similarity measures are also provided. We compare
these new methods to the widely used Euclidean and time warping distance
functions (for real and synthetic data) and show the superiority of our
approach, especially in the strong presence of noise. We prove a weaker
version of the triangle inequality and employ it in an indexing
structure to answer nearest neighbor queries. Finally, we present
experimental results that validate the accuracy and efficiency of our
approach},

abstract = {We present an approach for the joint segmentation and classification of a time series. The segmentation is on the basis of a menu of possible statistical models: each of these must be describable in terms of a sufficient statistic, but there is no need for these sufficient statistics to be the same, and these can be as complex (for example, cepstral features or autoregressive coefficients) as fits. All that is needed is the probability density function (PDF) of each sufficient statistic under its own assumed model--presumably this comes from training data, and it is particularly appealing that there is no need at all for a joint statistical characterization of all the statistics. There is similarly no need for an a-priori specification of the number of sections, as the approach uses an appropriate penalization of an over-zealous segmentation. The scheme has two stages. In stage one, rough segmentations are implemented sequentially using a piecewise generalized likelihood ratio (GLR); in the second stage, the results from the first stage (both forward and backward) are refined. The computational burden is remarkably small, approximately linear with the length of the time series, and the method is nicely accurate in terms both of discovered number of segments and of segmentation accuracy. A hybrid of the approach with one based on Gibbs sampling is also presented; this combination is somewhat slower but considerably more accurate.},

abstract = {Pattern theorem in financial time-series is one of the most important technical analysis methods in financial prediction. Recent researches have achieved big progresses in identifying and recognizing time-series patterns. And most of the recent works on time-series deal with this task by using static approaches and mainly focus on the recognition accuracy, but considering that recognition of patterns in financial time-series, especially for stock time-series, are always time-consuming rather than pattern recognition in other fields, a dynamic recognition approach is more preferable so that investment on stock pattern become executable. In this paper we propose a dynamic approach for extracting and recognizing the patterns in stock-series. In our approach a slide window with flexible length is defined for extracting feature vertexes in stock-series, and in addition, a dynamic perceptual important point (PIP) locating method is proposed based on the PIP locating method for avoiding the computation expense problem and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is involved for pattern recognition and window length identification.},

abstract = {The analysis of historical process data of technological systems plays important role in process monitoring, modelling and control. Time-series segmentation algorithms are often used to detect homogenous periods of operation-based on input-output process data. However, historical process data alone may not be sufficient for the monitoring of complex processes. This paper incorporates the first-principle model of the process into the segmentation algorithm. The key idea is to use a model-based non-linear state-estimation algorithm to detect the changes in the correlation among the state-variables. The homogeneity of the time-series segments is measured using a PCA similarity factor calculated from the covariance matrices given by the state-estimation algorithm. The whole approach is applied to the monitoring of an industrial high-density polyethylene plant. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An innovations state space modeling framework is introduced for forecasting complex seasonal time series such as those with multiple seasonal periods, high-frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality, and dual-calendar effects. The new framework incorporates Box–Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself.},

As with most computer science problems, representation of the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions. One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation. This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time series data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In this chapter, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data mining perspective.

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. ?? 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the prediction of a data point is provided as follows: first, the pattern sequence prior to the day to be predicted is extracted. Then, this sequence is searched in the historical data and the prediction is calculated by averaging all the samples immediately after the matched sequence. The main novelty is that only the labels associated with each pattern are considered to forecast the future behavior of the time series, avoiding the use of real values of the time series until the last step of the prediction process. Results from several energy time series are reported and the performance of the proposed method is compared to that of recently published techniques showing a remarkable improvement in the prediction.},

The existing distance functions are usually sensitive to noise, shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, disturbance signals, and different sampling rates. Cleaning data to eliminate these is not always possible. In this paper, we introduce a novel distance function, Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) which is robust against these data imperfections. Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP), and Longest Common Subsequences (LCSS), indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclidean distance, DTW and ERP, and it is on average 50\% more accurate than LCSS. We also develop three pruning techniques to improve the retrieval efficiency of EDR and show that these techniques can be combined effectively in a search, increasing the pruning power significantly. The experimental results confirm the superior efficiency of the combined methods.},

abstract = {In many applications, there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We call these "hierarchical time series". They are commonly forecast using either a "bottom-up" or a "top-down" method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Temporally evolving data brings a lot of new challenges to the data mining and machine learning community. This paper is concerned with the recognition of recurring patterns within multivariate time series, which capture the evolution of multiple parameters over a certain period of time. Our approach first separates a time series into segments that can be considered as situations, and then clusters the recognized segments into groups of similar context. The time series segmentation is established in a bottom-up manner according the correlation of the individual signals. Recognized segments are grouped in terms of statistical features using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The proposed approach is evaluated on the basis of real-life sensor data from different vehicles recorded during car drives. According to our evaluation it is feasible to recognize recurring patterns in time series by means of bottom-up segmentation and hierarchical clustering.},

A novel hybrid neural network algorithm for noisy time series prediction is presented which exhibits excellent performance on the problem. The method is motivated by consideration of how neural networks work, and by fundamental difficulties with random correlations when dealing with small sample sizes and high noise data. The method permits the inference and extraction of rules. One of the greatest complaints against neural networks is that it is hard to figure out exactly what they are doing-this work provides one answer for the internal workings of the network. Furthermore, these rules can be used to gain insight into both the real world system and the predictor. The paper focuses on noisy time series prediction and rule inference-use of the system in trading would typically involve the utilization of other financial indicators and domain knowledge},

The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by applying to the Mozilla data set to study the change frequency and developer activity profiles. The experimental results show that the segmentation algorithm produces segments that capture meaningful information and is superior to the information content obtaining by arbitrarily segmenting time period into regular time intervals.},

A simple example is a rule such as "a period of low telephone call activity is usually followed by a sharp rise in call volume". Examples of rules relating two or more time series are "if the Microsoft stock price goes up and Intel falls, then IBM goes up the next day," and "if Microsoft goes up strongly for one day, then declines strongly on the next day, and on the same days Intel stays about level, then IBM stays about level." Our emphasis is in the discovery of local patterns in multivariate time series, in contrast to traditional time series analysis which largely focuses on global models. Thus, we search for rules whose conditions refer to patterns in time series. However, we do not want to define beforehand which patterns are to be used; rather, we want the patterns to be formed from the data in t...},

A time series of demand recorded at half-hourly intervals contains more than one seasonal pattern. A within-day seasonal cycle is apparent from the similarity of the demand profile from one day to the next,and a within-week seasonal cycle is evident when one compares the demand on the corresponding day of adjacent weeks. There is strong appeal in using a forecasting method that is able to capture both seasonalities. The multiplicative seasonal ARIMA model has been adapted for this purpose. In this paper,we adapt the Holt–Winters exponential smoothing formulation so that it can accommodate two seasonalities. We correct for residual autocorrelation using a simple autoregressive model. The forecasts produced by the new double seasonal Holt–Winters method outperform those from traditional Holt–Winters and from a well-specified multiplicative double seasonal ARIMA model.},

abstract = {Existing studies on time series are based on two categories of distance functions. The first category consists of the Lp-norms. They are metric distance functions but cannot support local time shifting. The second category consists of distance functions which are capable of handling local time shifting but are nonmetric. The first contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new distance function, which we call ERP ("Edit distance with Real Penalty"). Representing a marriage of L1- norm and the edit distance, ERP can support local time shifting, and is a metric. The second contribution of the paper is the development of pruning strategies for large time series databases. Given that ERP is a metric, one way to prune is to apply the triangle inequality. Another way to prune is to develop a lower bound on the ERP distance. We propose such a lower bound, which has the nice computational property that it can be efficiently indexed with a standard B+- tree. Moreover, we show that these two ways of pruning can be used simultaneously for ERP distances. Specifically, the false positives obtained from the B+-tree can be further minimized by applying the triangle inequality. Based on extensive experimentation with existing benchmarks and techniques, we show that this combination delivers superb pruning power and search time performance, and dominates all existing strategies.},

A novel and flexible approach is proposed based on segmental semi-Markov models. Unlike dynamic time-warping or template-matching, the proposed framework provides a principled and coherent framework for leveraging both prior knowledge and training data. The pattern of interest is modeled as a K-state segmental hidden Markov model where each state is responsible for the generation of a component of the overall shape using a stet-based regression function. The distance (in time) between segments can be constructed from a single training example. Recognition of a pattern in a new time series is achieved by recursive Viterbi-like algorithm which scales linearly in the length of the sequence. The method is successfully demonstrated on real data sets, including an application to end-point detection in semiconductor manufacturing.},

The common use of clustering algorithms in time series is to discover to groups sets of data with common characteristic their proximity. This property is used by several hybrid forecasting algorithms that additionally employ a function approximation technique to model interactions within each cluster. The proposed hybrid clustering algorithm (HCA) is a data analysis oriented clustering based on an iterative procedure that creates groups of data whose common property is that they are best described by the same linear relationship. A complementary pattern recognition scheme is employed to assist its implementation in time series forecasting. In this paper the HCA methodology is tested on the benchmark sunspots series, the daily closing values of the Dow Jones Index and hourly surface ozone concentrations. It exhibited a reduction of the forecasting error, in excess of 9\%, when compared to other approaches met in the literature.},

Our formulation provides a model for several existing seasonal methods and also provides new options, which result in superior forecasting performance over a range of prediction horizons. In particular, seasonal components can be updated more frequently than once during a seasonal cycle.

abstract = {The computerization of our society has substantially enhanced our capabilities for both generating and collecting data from diverse sources. A tremendous amount of data has flooded almost every aspect of our lives. This explosive growth in stored or transient data has generated an urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can intelligently assist us in transforming the vast amounts of data into useful information and knowledge. This has led to the generation of a promising and flourishing frontier in computer science called data mining, and its various applications. Data mining, also popularly referred to as knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams. This book explores the concepts and techniques of knowledge discovery and data mining. As amultidisciplinaryfield, datamining drawsonworkfromareas including statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database technology, information retrieval, network science, knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and data visualization. We focus on issues relating to the feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability of techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets. As a result, this book is not intended as an introduction to statistics, machine learning, database systems, or other such areas, although we do provide some background knowledge to facilitate the reader’s comprehension of their respective roles in data mining. Rather, the book is a comprehensive introduction to data mining. It is useful for computing science students, application developers, and business professionals, as well as researchers involved in any of the disciplines previously listed. Data mining emerged during the late 1980s, made great strides during the 1990s, and continues to flourish into the new millennium. This book presents an overall picture of the field, introducing interesting data mining techniques and systems and discussing applications and research directions. An important motivation for writing this book was the need to build an organized framework for the study of data mining—a challenging task, owing to the extensive multidisciplinary nature of this fast-developing field. We hope that this book will encourage people with different backgrounds and experiences to exchange their views regarding data mining so as to contribute toward the further promotion and shaping of this exciting and dynamic field.},

abstract = {Much of the world’s supply of data is in the form of time series. In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in mining time series data. A number of new algorithms have been introduced to classify, cluster, segment, index, discover rules, and detect anomalies/novelties in time series. While these many different techniques used to solve these problems use a multitude of different techniques, they all have one common factor; they require some high level representation of the data, rather than the original raw data. These high level representations are necessary as a feature extraction step, or simply to make the storage, transmission, and computation of massive dataset feasible. A multitude of representations have been proposed in the literature, including spectral transforms, wavelets transforms, piecewise polynomials, eigenfunctions, and symbolic mappings. This chapter gives a high-level survey of time series Data Mining tasks, with an emphasis on time series representations.},

abstract = {Abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.},

Classifying human motions is a critical task in motion editing and synthesizing, for which manual labeling is clearly inefficient for large databases. Here we study the general problem of time series clustering. We propose a novel method of clustering time series that can (a) learn joint temporal dynamics in the data; (b) handle time lags; and (c) produce interpretable features. We achieve this by developing complex-valued linear dynamical systems (CLDS), which include real-valued Kalman filters as a special case; our advantage is that the transition matrix is simpler (just diagonal), and the transmission one easier to interpret. We then present Complex-Fit, a novel EM algorithm to learn the parameters for the general model and its special case for clustering. Our approach produces significant improvement in clustering quality, 1.5 to 5 times better than well-known competitors on real motion capture sequences. 1.},

When the time series is very long, some clustering algorithms may fail because the very notation of similarity is dubious in high dimension space; many methods cannot handle missing data when the clustering is based on a distance metric. This paper proposes a method for clustering of time series based on their structural characteristics. Unlike other alternatives, this method does not cluster point values using a distance metric, rather it clusters based on global features extracted from the time series. The feature measures are obtained from each individual series and can be fed into arbitrary clustering algorithms, including an unsupervised neural network algorithm, self-organizing map, or hierarchal clustering algorithm. Global measures describing the time series are obtained by applying statistical operations that best capture the underlying characteristics: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, chaos, nonlinearity, and self-similarity. Since the method clusters using extracted global measures, it reduces the dimensionality of the time series and is much less sensitive to missing or noisy data. We further provide a search mechanism to find the best selection from the feature set that should be used as the clustering inputs. The proposed technique has been tested using benchmark time series datasets previously reported for time series clustering and a set of time series datasets with known characteristics. The empirical results show that our approach is able to yield meaningful clusters. The resulting clusters are similar to those produced by other methods, but with some promising and interesting variations that can be intuitively explained with knowledge of the global characteristics of the time series.

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. ?? 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Temporally evolving data brings a lot of new challenges to the data mining and machine learning community. This paper is concerned with the recognition of recurring patterns within multivariate time series, which capture the evolution of multiple parameters over a certain period of time. Our approach first separates a time series into segments that can be considered as situations, and then clusters the recognized segments into groups of similar context. The time series segmentation is established in a bottom-up manner according the correlation of the individual signals. Recognized segments are grouped in terms of statistical features using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The proposed approach is evaluated on the basis of real-life sensor data from different vehicles recorded during car drives. According to our evaluation it is feasible to recognize recurring patterns in time series by means of bottom-up segmentation and hierarchical clustering.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for discovering patterns in time series and other sequential data. We exhibit a reliable procedure for building the minimal set of hidden, Markovian states that is statistically capable of producing the behavior exhibited in the data -- the underlying process's causal states. Unlike conventional methods for fitting hidden Markov models (HMMs) to data, our algorithm makes no assumptions about the process's causal architecture (the number of hidden states and their transition structure), but rather infers it from the data. It starts with assumptions of minimal structure and introduces complexity only when the data demand it. Moreover, the causal states it infers have important predictive optimality properties that conventional HMM states lack. We introduce the algorithm, review the theory behind it, prove its asymptotic reliability, use large deviation theory to estimate its rate of convergence, and compare it to other algorithms which also construct HMMs from data. We also illustrate its behavior on an example process, and report selected numerical results from an implementation.},

abstract = {Today, there are more and more time series data that coexist with other data. These data exist in useful and understandable patterns. Data management of time series data must take into account an integrated approach. However, many researches face numeric data attributes. Therefore, the need for time series data mining tool has become extremely important. The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel pattern in mining architecture with mixed attributes that uses a systematic approach in the financial database information mining. Time series pattern mining (TSPM) architecture combines the extended visualization-induced self-organizing map algorithm and the extended Na??ve Bayesian algorithm. This mining architecture can simulate human intelligence and discover patterns automatically. The TSPM approach also demonstrates good returns in pattern research. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In many applications, there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We call these "hierarchical time series". They are commonly forecast using either a "bottom-up" or a "top-down" method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian approach to discovering patterns in structurally complex processes. The proposed method of Bayesian structural inference (BSI) relies on a set of candidate unifilar hidden Markov model (uHMM) topologies for inference of process structure from a data series. We employ a recently developed exact enumeration of topological $\epsilon$-machines. (A sequel then removes the topological restriction.) This subset of the uHMM topologies has the added benefit that inferred models are guaranteed to be $\epsilon$-machines, irrespective of estimated transition probabilities. Properties of $\epsilon$-machines and uHMMs allow for the derivation of analytic expressions for estimating transition probabilities, inferring start states, and comparing the posterior probability of candidate model topologies, despite process internal structure being only indirectly present in data. We demonstrate BSI's effectiveness in estimating a process's randomness, as reflected by the Shannon entropy rate, and its structure, as quantified by the statistical complexity. We also compare using the posterior distribution over candidate models and the single, maximum a posteriori model for point estimation and show that the former more accurately reflects uncertainty in estimated values. We apply BSI to in-class examples of finite- and infinite-order Markov processes, as well to an out-of-class, infinite-state hidden process.},

A number of new algorithms have been introduced to classify, cluster, segment, index, discover rules, and detect anomalies/novelties in time series. While these many different techniques used to solve these problems use a multitude of different techniques, they all have one common factor; they require some high level representation of the data, rather than the original raw data. These high level representations are necessary as a feature extraction step, or simply to make the storage, transmission, and computation of massive dataset feasible. A multitude of representations have been proposed in the literature, including spectral transforms, wavelets transforms, piecewise polynomials, eigenfunctions, and symbolic mappings.

The common use of clustering algorithms in time series is to discover to groups sets of data with common characteristic their proximity. This property is used by several hybrid forecasting algorithms that additionally employ a function approximation technique to model interactions within each cluster. The proposed hybrid clustering algorithm (HCA) is a data analysis oriented clustering based on an iterative procedure that creates groups of data whose common property is that they are best described by the same linear relationship. A complementary pattern recognition scheme is employed to assist its implementation in time series forecasting. In this paper the HCA methodology is tested on the benchmark sunspots series, the daily closing values of the Dow Jones Index and hourly surface ozone concentrations. It exhibited a reduction of the forecasting error, in excess of 9\%, when compared to other approaches met in the literature.},

We establish a direct relationship between Bayesian evidence and the partition function which allows for straightforward calculation of the expectation and variance of the conditional relative entropy and the source entropy rate.

Neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. These neurotoxins comprise small diffusible Abeta oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. At cell surfaces, ADDLs bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. Germ-line knockout of Fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in Alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. Remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by ADDLs occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. Without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, ADDLs inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. We hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage Alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of Abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.},

We achieve this by developing complex-valued linear dynamical systems (CLDS), which include real-valued Kalman filters as a special case; our advantage is that the transition matrix is simpler (just diagonal), and the transmission one easier to interpret. We then present Complex-Fit, a novel EM algorithm to learn the parameters for the general model and its special case for clustering.

The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting specific patterns or shapes in time-series data. A novel and flexible approach is proposed based on segmental semi-Markov models. Unlike dynamic time-warping or template-matching, the proposed framework provides a principled and coherent framework for leveraging both prior knowledge and training data. The pattern of interest is modeled as a K-state segmental hidden Markov model where each state is responsible for the generation of a component of the overall shape using a stet-based regression function. The distance (in time) between segments can be constructed from a single training example. Recognition of a pattern in a new time series is achieved by recursive Viterbi-like algorithm which scales linearly in the length of the sequence. The method is successfully demonstrated on real data sets, including an application to end-point detection in semiconductor manufacturing.},

abstract = {Load time series segmentation can serve as the basis for the implementation of variety of applications that have the potential to modify the demand patterns. The scope of this study is three-fold. Firstly, a novel modeling technique of the metered load data of a high voltage industrial consumer is introduced. Instead of representing the daily load curve with a vector with T elements, where T is the time interval of the metering, it is proposed to represent the demand with six indicators that are related with the shape of the curve. Secondly, a new clustering algorithm is introduced in the load time series segmentation field of research. Lastly, a new clustering validity indicator is proposed that can provide an accurate evidence on the optimal number of clusters. The data under study are the active and reactive metered load of a full year.},

abstract = {This work proposes a novel general-purpose forecasting algorithm. It first extracts patterns from time series using the information provided by certain clustering techniques, which are applied as a first step of the approach. Moreover, the occurrence of data with especially unexpected values (outliers) is also addressed in this work. To deal with these outliers, a new hybrid methodology has been proposed, by inserting and adapting an existing approach based on the discovery of frequent episodes in sequences in the general scheme of prediction.},

abstract = {Pattern theorem in financial time-series is one of the most important technical analysis methods in financial prediction. Recent researches have achieved big progresses in identifying and recognizing time-series patterns. And most of the recent works on time-series deal with this task by using static approaches and mainly focus on the recognition accuracy, but considering that recognition of patterns in financial time-series, especially for stock time-series, are always time-consuming rather than pattern recognition in other fields, a dynamic recognition approach is more preferable so that investment on stock pattern become executable. In this paper we propose a dynamic approach for extracting and recognizing the patterns in stock-series. In our approach a slide window with flexible length is defined for extracting feature vertexes in stock-series, and in addition, a dynamic perceptual important point (PIP) locating method is proposed based on the PIP locating method for avoiding the computation expense problem and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is involved for pattern recognition and window length identification.},

@article{Ghassempour2014,
abstract = {In this paper we describe an algorithm for clustering multivariate time series with variables taking both categorical and continuous values. Time series of this type are frequent in health care, where they represent the health trajectories of individuals. The problem is challenging because categorical variables make it difficult to define a meaningful distance between trajectories. We propose an approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), where we first map each trajectory into an HMM, then define a suitable distance between HMMs and finally proceed to cluster the HMMs with a method based on a distance matrix. We test our approach on a simulated, but realistic, data set of 1,255 trajectories of individuals of age 45 and over, on a synthetic validation set with known clustering structure, and on a smaller set of 268 trajectories extracted from the longitudinal Health and Retirement Survey. The proposed method can be implemented quite simply using standard packages in R and Matlab and may be a good candidate for solving the difficult problem of clustering multivariate time series with categorical variables using tools that do not require advanced statistic knowledge, and therefore are accessible to a wide range of researchers.},
